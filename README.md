# Why Webp?
I have done a lot of experiments on the effects of Webp vs Png in Quality and file sizes, using a 6752 x 3955 image.
When Webp has a quality of 99 (near loseless, but it's now lossy), has a size of 2.5 MB.
For PNG it has a size of 17.9 MB (loseless).
I was Unable to Distinguish between the two pictures. On that Conclusion Webp is better.

# Planned
- put together with other modules to form a big modding script for WoTB.
